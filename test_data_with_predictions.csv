Introduction,63119fc8d237f3f820fbce09,[],,[],[]
"The intention of this Regulation is to establish uniform provisions for Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) fitted to motor vehicles of the Categories M1 and N1 primarily used within urban driving conditions. The system shall automatically detect an imminent forward collision, provide the driver with an appropriate warning and activate the vehicle braking system to decelerate the vehicle with the purpose of avoiding or mitigating the severity of a collision in the event that the driver does not respond to the warning. In the case of a failure in the system, the safe operation of the vehicle shall not be endangered. During any action taken by the system, the driver can, at any time through a conscious action, e.g. by a steering action or an accelerator kick-down, take control and override the system. This Regulation cannot cover all the traffic conditions and infrastructure features in the type-approval process; this Regulation recognises that the performances required in this Regulation cannot be achieved in all conditions (vehicle condition, road adhesion, weather conditions, deteriorated road infrastructure and traffic scenarios etc. may affect the system performances). Actual conditions and features in the real world should not result in false warnings or false braking to the extent that they encourage the driver to switch the system off. The Regulation provides the requirements for the approval for an AEBS designed to avoid collision either with cars or pedestrians or both. This Regulation is an ""if-fitted"" regulation. It shall not prevent contracting parties from mandating the fitting of AEBS designed to avoid collision either with cars or pedestrians or both approved in accordance to this Regulation.",63119fc8d237f3f820fbce0a,[],,[],[]

This annex shall also apply to safety related functions identified in this Regulation which are controlled by electronic system(s) (paragraph 2.3.) as far as this Regulation is concerned. This annex does not specify the performance criteria for ""The System"" but covers the methodology applied to the design process and the information which must be disclosed to the Technical Service, for type approval purposes.

"2.2. ""Safety Concept"" is a description of the measures designed into the system, for example within the electronic units, so as to address system integrity and thereby ensure safe operation under fault and non-fault conditions, including in the event of an electrical failure. The possibility of a fall-back to partial operation or even to a back-up system for vital vehicle functions may be a part of the safety concept.",63119fc8d237f3f820fbceb2,[],paragraph 2.2.,[],[]
"2.3. ""Electronic Control System"" means a combination of units, designed to co-operate in the production of the stated vehicle control function by electronic data processing. Such systems, often controlled by software, are built from discrete functional components such as sensors, electronic control units and actuators and connected by transmission links. They may include mechanical, electro-pneumatic or electro-hydraulic elements.",63119fc8d237f3f820fbceb3,[],paragraph 2.3.,[],[]
"2.4. ""Complex Electronic Vehicle Control Systems"" are those electronic control systems in which a function controlled by an electronic system or the driver may be over-ridden by a higher-level electronic control system/function. A function which is over-ridden becomes part of the complex system, as well as any overriding system/function within the scope of this Regulation. The transmission links to and from overriding systems/function outside of the scope of this Regulation shall also be included.",63119fc8d237f3f820fbceb4,[],paragraph 2.4.,[],[]
"2.5. ""Higher-Level Electronic Control"" systems/functions are those which employ additional processing and/or sensing provisions to modify vehicle behaviour by commanding variations in the function(s) of the vehicle control system. This allows complex systems to automatically change their objectives with a priority which depends on the sensed circumstances.",63119fc8d237f3f820fbceb5,[],paragraph 2.5.,[],[]

"2.7. ""Transmission links"" are the means used for inter-connecting distributed units for the purpose of conveying signals, operating data or an energy supply. This equipment is generally electrical but may, in some part, be mechanical, pneumatic or hydraulic.",63119fc8d237f3f820fbceb7,[],paragraph 2.7.,[],[]
